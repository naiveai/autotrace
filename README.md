# AutoTrace

An old Flutter application that provides basic tracking of vehicles - you can scan a VIN barcode,
mark it as parked in our taken out, and see how many vehicles are present and in what lots.

Not terribly realistic for the needs of someone actually managing hundreds of vehicles, but hey.
